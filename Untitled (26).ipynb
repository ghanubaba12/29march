    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "ans-\n",
    "Lasso regression is a type of linear regression that uses regularization to shrink the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing feature selection. The term \"lasso\" stands for \"least absolute shrinkage and selection operator.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between lasso regression and other regression techniques is that it adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is the sum of the squared residuals between the predicted and actual values. This penalty term is proportional to the absolute values of the coefficients of the regression variables, and it can be tuned with a hyperparameter to adjust the degree of regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using lasso regression, it is possible to identify and remove irrelevant or redundant features from the model, reducing overfitting and improving its interpretability. In contrast, other regression techniques, such as linear regression and ridge regression, do not explicitly perform feature selection and may include all available features in the model, leading to higher variance and potentially reduced interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, lasso regression is a useful technique for performing feature selection and regularization in linear regression, providing a trade-off between bias and variance in the model.\n",

    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "ans-\n",
    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection is that it performs both feature selection and regularization simultaneously. Lasso Regression adds a penalty term to the least squares objective function, which helps to shrink the coefficients of the less important variables to zero. This results in a sparse model, where only the most relevant variables are retained, and the rest are eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other feature selection methods, such as stepwise regression or best subset selection, Lasso Regression has the advantage of being able to handle a large number of features and identify a smaller subset of features that are relevant for the prediction task. Moreover, the L1 regularization used in Lasso Regression encourages sparsity and can help prevent overfitting by reducing the variance of the estimates.\n",

    "Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "ans-\n",
    "The coefficients of a Lasso Regression model can be interpreted in the same way as those of a standard linear regression model. Each coefficient represents the change in the target variable associated with a one-unit increase in the corresponding predictor variable, holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in Lasso Regression, some coefficients may be shrunk towards zero due to the regularization penalty, indicating that these variables are less important for predicting the target variable. The magnitude of the coefficient reflects the strength of the relationship between the predictor and target variables, with larger coefficients indicating a stronger relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the interpretation of coefficients in Lasso Regression should take into account the regularization parameter. The higher the regularization parameter, the more coefficients will be shrunk towards zero, and the smaller the coefficients will be in magnitude. Therefore, the interpretation of the coefficients should be based on the chosen regularization parameter and the resulting coefficients after fitting the model.\n",

However, it is possible to use Lasso Regression for non-linear regression problems by incorporating non-linear transformations of the predictor variables into the model.\n",

By including polynomial features in the Lasso Regression model, it is possible to capture non-linear relationships between the predictor and target variables.\n",

    "Another approach to non-linear regression using Lasso Regression is to use kernel methods. Kernel methods involve mapping the original features into a higher-dimensional space, where the data may be more separable.

Ridge Regression adds a penalty term proportional to the sum of the squared coefficients, while Lasso Regression adds a penalty term proportional to the sum of the absolute coefficients.\n",

    "This difference in the penalty terms has several consequences. First, Ridge Regression tends to shrink all coefficients towards zero, but not necessarily to exactly zero.

Second, Lasso Regression can lead to some coefficients being exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection and removing less important variables from the model.\n",

    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features, but in a different way than other regression techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated with each other. When this happens, it can be difficult to determine the contribution of each variable to the dependent variable.\n",

    "In Lasso Regression, the penalty term added to the objective function encourages sparsity in the model, which can help to reduce the impact of multicollinearity.

As a result, only the most relevant variables are retained, and the effects of multicollinearity are reduced.\n",
